# REKT Shield — Demo Video Script
## Duration: ~2:30 minutes
## Style: Cyberpunk tech demo, dark theme, high energy

---

## SCENE 1: HOOK (0:00 - 0:15)

**[VISUAL: Dark screen, green terminal text typing out]**

**NARRATION:**
"One billion dollars. That's how much was stolen from Solana users through rug pulls, drainers, and state-sponsored attacks last year. Every single victim found out too late. What if your wallet had an immune system?"

---

## SCENE 2: INTRO (0:15 - 0:30)

**[VISUAL: REKT Shield logo animation, neon green glow, boot sequence scrolling]**

**NARRATION:**
"Introducing REKT Shield — a self-healing digital immune system for Solana. Eleven autonomous AI agents, modeled after the human body's defense system, working twenty-four-seven with zero human intervention. Predict. Detect. Defend. Self-heal. Repeat."

---

## SCENE 3: THE 11 AGENTS (0:30 - 1:00)

**[VISUAL: Dashboard agent grid showing all 11 agents with ACTIVE status]**

**NARRATION:**
"Eleven agents. Four tiers. One coordinated swarm."

"The Detection Tier — Scanner analyzes every token in real-time with a risk score from zero to one hundred. Sentinel monitors your wallet twenty-four-seven. Network watches Solana's infrastructure for DDoS and MEV attacks."

"The Defense Tier — Guardian executes emergency swaps and revokes approvals automatically. Honeypot deploys bait wallets to catch and profile attackers."

"The Intelligence Tier — Intel maintains an on-chain threat registry. Lazarus is the first tool on Solana tracking North Korean state-sponsored hackers. Prophet predicts rug pulls using three hundred sixty-one thousand pool patterns."

"Support and Autonomy — Reporter mints Protection Proof NFTs. Quantum assesses post-quantum readiness. And Healer — the brain — self-heals the entire system with circuit breakers and a six-phase incident response pipeline."

---

## SCENE 4: RISK-AWARE SWAPS (1:00 - 1:30)

**[VISUAL: Swap tab — connecting Phantom wallet, entering a swap, risk scan running]**

**NARRATION:**
"But REKT Shield isn't just passive defense. Connect your Phantom, Solflare, or Torus wallet and trade safely with our risk-aware swap engine."

"Every single swap is auto-scanned before execution. Safe tokens go through. Risky tokens get blocked. You'll see the exact risk score, liquidity analysis, and rug probability before you sign anything."

**[VISUAL: Emergency Evacuate section scanning a wallet]**

"And if your wallet is already compromised? Hit Emergency Evacuate. It scans every token in your wallet, identifies the dangerous ones, and prepares batch swaps to USDC — all in one click."

---

## SCENE 5: SELF-HEALING (1:30 - 1:50)

**[VISUAL: Healer tab — agent health table, incident log, circuit breaker status]**

**NARRATION:**
"What makes REKT Shield truly autonomous is the self-healing engine. If any agent fails, the Healer detects it in fifteen seconds, classifies the threat with Claude AI, contains it, executes defense, restarts the failed agent, and learns from the incident. Six phases. Zero humans. Circuit breakers prevent cascade failures. The system literally gets stronger after every attack."

---

## SCENE 6: AI CHAT (1:50 - 2:05)

**[VISUAL: AI Chat tab — asking "What are the current threats on Solana?"]**

**NARRATION:**
"Need real-time threat intelligence? Chat directly with Claude AI. Ask about any token, any threat, any wallet. The AI has full context from all eleven agents and responds with actionable security insights."

---

## SCENE 7: TECH STACK (2:05 - 2:15)

**[VISUAL: Quick montage of tech logos — Solana, Jupiter, Helius, Pyth, Claude, Next.js, TypeScript]**

**NARRATION:**
"Built on Solana mainnet with Jupiter for swaps, Helius for real-time data, Pyth for price oracles, Metaplex for NFTs, and Claude AI for intelligence. Thirty-three REST API endpoints. Eight dashboard tabs. All open source."

---

## SCENE 8: CLOSE (2:15 - 2:30)

**[VISUAL: Dashboard full view, all agents active, then tagline animation]**

**NARRATION:**
"Eleven agents. Zero humans. Total defense. REKT Shield — the immune system Solana deserves."

**[VISUAL: Text appears — "Don't get rekt. Get shielded." followed by GitHub link and demo URL]**

**TEXT ON SCREEN:**
- GitHub: github.com/YouthAIAgent/rekt-shield
- Live Demo: rekt-shield.vercel.app
- Built for Colosseum Agent Hackathon 2026
